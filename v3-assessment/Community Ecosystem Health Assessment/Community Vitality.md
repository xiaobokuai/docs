# Metrics in Assessment Model

## Community Popularity

The community popularity model focuses on the project's visibility and attention in the developer community, reflecting the project's market influence.

### Project Stars Growth

- Definition: The number of new Stars added to the project during the statistical period.
- Weight: 50%
- Threshold: 100

The number of Stars is an intuitive indicator of project popularity. The growth of new Stars reflects the project's attention and attractiveness in the developer community. Continuously growing Stars indicate that the project has good market influence and a user base.

### Project Forks Growth

- Definition: The number of new Forks added to the project during the statistical period.
- Weight: 50%
- Threshold: 100

The number of Forks reflects developers' willingness to participate in the project. New Forks indicate that developers are interested in the project and wish to conduct secondary development or contribute code based on the project. This is an important indicator for evaluating project activity and developer participation.

## Contribution Activity

The contribution activity model focuses on the frequency and scale of community contributions, reflecting the community's activity level.

### Code Commit Count

- Definition: The total number of code commits during the statistical period.
- Weight: 20%
- Threshold: 12850

Code commit count is a core indicator of project development activity. High-frequency code commits indicate that the project is in active development and community contributors are continuously engaged. This metric reflects the project's overall workload and development speed.

### Lines of Code Change

- Definition: The total number of new and modified lines of code during the statistical period.
- Weight: 20%
- Threshold: 300000

Lines of code change reflects the scale of code contributions to the project. Although lines of code cannot directly measure code quality, it can reflect the community's development investment level. Continuously growing lines of code indicate that the project is constantly evolving and improving.

### PR Comment Count

- Definition: The total number of PR comments during the statistical period.
- Weight: 20%
- Threshold: 10

PR comment count reflects the community's code review activity. Active PR comments indicate that the community values code quality and collaborative development. This metric can reflect the community's collaboration atmosphere and technical exchange depth.

### New Issue Count

- Definition: The total number of new Issues created during the statistical period.
- Weight: 20%
- Threshold: 10

New Issue count reflects the community's problem feedback activity. New Issues include bug reports, feature requests, usage inquiries, and other types. This metric can reflect users' attention to the project and willingness to participate.

### Issue Comment Count

- Definition: The total number of Issue comments during the statistical period.
- Weight: 20%
- Threshold: 10

Issue comment count reflects the community's problem discussion activity. Active Issue comments indicate that the community has a good communication atmosphere and problem-solving capability. This metric can reflect the community's collaboration efficiency and user support quality.

## Developer Base

The developer base model focuses on the scale of community contributors, reflecting the community's talent foundation.

### Community Contributor Count

- Definition: The total number of people participating in community contributions during the statistical period.
- Weight: 33%
- Threshold: 2000

Community contributor count is a core indicator of community scale. Contributors include code contributors and non-code contributors, reflecting the breadth of community participation. A large contributor base is an important guarantee for the community's sustainable development.

### Code Contributor Count

- Definition: The number of people participating in code contributions during the statistical period.
- Weight: 33%
- Threshold: 1000

Code contributor count reflects the community's technical contribution capability. Code contributors are the core force driving the project's technical development. This metric can reflect the project's technical attractiveness and development activity.

### Non-Code Contributor Count

- Definition: The number of users who have made any contributions in the community during the statistical period, including but not limited to creating or commenting on issues, participating in project discussions, etc., but have not engaged in any code-related behaviors.
- Weight: 17%
- Threshold: 1000

The number of non-code contributors reflects the diversity of community participation. This metric counts contributors in the community who do not participate in direct code production activities—such as code commits and merges—but who contribute to the project’s development through project maintenance, issue management, and community interaction. Based on the type of contribution, these contributors can be categorized into the following roles:

- Documentation Maintainers: Responsible for maintaining project-related textual information, including refining the descriptions of issues and pull requests and modifying title information.

- Issue Managers: Responsible for managing the lifecycle of issues, including creating issues, applying tags, tracking statuses, closing issues, and linking them to pull requests.

- Pull Request Collaboration Managers: Responsible for managing the pull request collaboration process, including task assignment, status maintenance, and tag management.

- Community Engagement Participants: Contribute to the project through lightweight community activities such as commenting on issues and participating in project discussions.

A large number of non-code contributors typically indicates a lower barrier to community participation, more diverse forms of contribution, and a more open and inclusive ecosystem.


### Community Followers Count

- Definition: The number of users who have starred or forked the project within the community during the statistical period.
- Weight: 17%
- Threshold: 1000

The number of community followers is a metric that measures a project’s community influence and external recognition. Followers include users who express their approval of the project and their intention to continue following it by “starring” it, as well as users who replicate and further develop the project by “forking” it. This metric reflects the community’s reach and the potential scale of participation.
